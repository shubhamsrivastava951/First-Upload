# [Classification Project](https://github.com/shubhamsrivastava951/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/ML_Classification.py)

* The dataset for this assignment is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin. It contains 699 examples described by 9 numeric attributes. There are two classes – class1 and class2. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass of the subject. Benign breast cancer tumours correspond to class1 and malignant breast cancer tumours correspond to class2. 

* I have investigated a real dataset by implementing multiple classification algorithms and Classified the target Variable into two class: Class1 and Class2. 
* I have first pre-process the dataset by replacing missing values and normalising the dataset with a min-max  scaler. 
* then I have evaluated  multiple  classification  algorithms:  K-Nearest  Neighbour,  Logistic Regression,  Naïve  Bayes,  Decision  Tree,  Support  Vector  Machine  and  ensembles  -Bagging,  Boosting  (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) and Random Forest.
* These will then be evaluated  using the stratified 10-fold cross validation method.

[Custering Project](https://github.com/shubhamsrivastava951/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/ML_Clustering.ipynb)

* The main task of this assignment is to apply different clustering methods on the two datasets and to find the best model with optimal parameters. In this assignment, you should use at least two different clustering evaluation/validation metrics for each clustering method and present and explain the evaluation results

In this assignment, you will be given the following two datasets:
# Travel Reviews Dataset: 
* This dataset contains reviews by travellers in 10 categories on destinations across East Asia. Each rating is mapped as Excellent(4), Very Good(3), Average(2), Poor(1), and  Terrible(0) and the average rating per traveller is reported. There is no gold cluster for this dataset.

# ICMLA 2014 Accepted Papers Dataset
* This dataset comprises the metadata for the 2014 ICMLA conference's accepted papers, including ID, paper titles, author's keywords, and abstracts. The column ‘session’ would represent the gold cluster.
