* The dataset for this assignment is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin. It contains 699 examples described by 9 numeric attributes. There are two classes – class1 and class2. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass of the subject. Benign breast cancer tumours correspond to class1 and malignant breast cancer tumours correspond to class2. 
*I have investigated a real dataset by implementing multiple classification algorithms and Classified the target Variable into two class: Class1 and Class2. 
*I have first pre-process the dataset by replacing missing values and normalising the dataset with a min-max  scaler. 
*then I have evaluated  multiple  classification  algorithms:  K-Nearest  Neighbour,  Logistic Regression,  Naïve  Bayes,  Decision  Tree,  Support  Vector  Machine  and  ensembles  -Bagging,  Boosting  (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) and Random Forest.
*These will then be evaluated  using the stratified 10-fold cross validation method.
